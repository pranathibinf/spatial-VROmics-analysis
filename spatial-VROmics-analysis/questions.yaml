task: You have been given processed Visium Human Lymph Node V1 spatial transcriptomics
  data (filtered feature-barcode HDF5 matrix from 10x Genomics). Using the provided
  workflow notebook and outputs, answer the following questions related to preprocessing,
  clustering, and visualization.
questions:
- id: q1
  stage: quality_control
  text: How many cells remain after filtering cells with fewer than 200 genes?
  answer_type: integer_exact
- id: q2
  stage: normalization
  text: How many highly variable genes (HVGs) were selected during preprocessing?
  answer_type: integer_exact
- id: q3
  stage: dimensionality_reduction
  text: What percentage of variance is explained by the first principal component
    (PC1)?
  answer_type: float_tolerance
- id: q4
  stage: clustering
  text: How many Leiden clusters were identified at resolution 0.5?
  answer_type: integer_exact
- id: q5
  stage: markers
  text: List the top 5 marker genes for cluster 0 by Wilcoxon ranking.
  answer_type: ordered_list
